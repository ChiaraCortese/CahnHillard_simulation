# Simulating a spinodal decomposition process governed by Cahn-Hilliard equation

This repository contains the material produced for the exam "Software and Computing for Applied Physics" - University of Bologna. It includes a simulation of a spinodal decomposition process, whose time evolution is described by the Cahn-Hilliard equation.

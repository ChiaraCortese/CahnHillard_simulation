# Simulating a spinodal decomposition process governed by Cahn-Hilliard equation

This repository contains the material produced for the exam "Software and Computing for Applied Physics" - University of Bologna. It includes a simulation of a spinodal decomposition process, whose time evolution is described by the Cahn-Hilliard equation.

## Spinodal decomposition and Cahn-Hilliard equation

Spinodal decomposition is a mechanism by which a solution of two or more components
can separate into distinct phases with distinctly different chemical compositions and
physical properties.
It's a continuous phase transformation that arise from instability of the order parameter of the transformation. In spinodal decomposition, the order parameter is a conserved quantity such as the concentration of species A and B in a binary alloy.
